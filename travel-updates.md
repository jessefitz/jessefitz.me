This is a page that should eventually contain information about travel I'm doing or want to do.  

In the meanwhile, I'll share some details about the plan (ideas) for my unplanned trip.

## Week 1

### Option 1: Home -> Great Lakes -> Upper Midwest

| Date       | Depart | Arrive | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| 2024-09-28 (Sat)| Home           | Findley State Park (Northwest-ish Ohio)      |    I'm hoping to head west, and this is west of home.   |
| 2024-09-29 (Sun)| Findley State Park| Rock Cut State Park (Northern Illinois) | I originally wanted to head north through Michigan, but the weather and logistics for working remotely wouldn't cooperate. Expect to work from Meg's in Rockford, IL on Monday morning. |
| 2024-09-30 (Mon) |  Rock Cut State Park | Buckhorn State Park (Wisconsin) | Continuing to travel Northwest on 90 in hopes to eventually find my way to Rt 2 running along the northern US border. Expecting work at the Starbucks in Tomah on Tuesday morning|
| 2024-09-30 (Tues) | Buckhorn State Park | Lake Wissota State Park (Northwestern WI) | Heading up Rt 94, Expected work location in Chippewa Falls |
| 2024-10-01 (Weds) | Lake Wissota State Park | Jay Cooke State Park (Duluth MN area) | By this point I will have reconnected with the original route planned through northern MI and will have a direct line of site to miles on rt. 2.  Expecting to find work location in Duluth.|
| 2024-10-02 (Thurs)| Jay Cooke State Park | Pokegama Dam Campground (Grand Rapids MN) | Now moving along Rt 2, should be able to find somewhere to work in Grand Rapids|
| Grand Forks? | - | - | - |

### Option 2: Home -> Midwest via Rt 90

Stick with Option 1 plans for Home -> Buckhorn SP (stay there Monday night, work from there on Tuesday) and instead of continuing north up to Rt 2, start heading west on 90.  This option mitigates some of the weather challenges but requires more research re: places to stay as I head west.
