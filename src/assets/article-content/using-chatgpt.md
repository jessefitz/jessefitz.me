# Schooled by ChatGPT

The most recent Hard Fork episode kicks off with a High School teacher in Oregon talking about her experiences using ChatGPT in her English and Creative Writing classes.  The perspectives she shares might leave listeners feeling slightly better about ChatGPT's positive influence on culture and education.  I thought I'd take some of the use cases she explained and try to attack one of my own personal writing assignments.

## What I set out to do

In my role as CTO of a small software startup, I think it's important to share outward facing content on our public website and/or relevant social channels.  My goal is for these messages to be concise and meaningful.  They should be used to celebrate our team, milestones and advances in our platform.  

I have some internal facing content to start with, and some other thoughts bouncing around my mind.  My goals is to share these thoughts and content with ChatGPT and have it serve as a critic of sorts.  The goal *is not* for ChatGPT to write content or generate new ideas.  Instead, it's to see if it can help me improve the concepts and content I already have.

## Rick-rolled by ChatGPT

Here's how it went.

### Initial Question to ChatGPT 
 *I'm the CTO of a small software startup company writing my first "A Message from the CTO" article to post on our public website and social media channels.  In the article I want to highlight and celebrate the team's hard work, some of our core design platform goals and encourage potential customers to sign up for our private preview program.  The opening paragraph of my article is "....".  Give me some constructive criticism about the paragraph, with a specific focus on how to be more precise and engaging.*|

### Ensuing Conversation
 ChatGPT suggested that I be more specific about how much work went into preparing for the release and that I provide more information about the goals and benefits of participating in the private preview program.  None of the suggestions were "copy/paste ready", but they were thought provoking.  In fact, ChatGPT's feedback in this conversation felt much like interacting with a colleague genuinely interested in helping me improve my content.

 I incorporated some of the suggestions, along with new ideas that were spawned from the interaction with ChatGPT.  I shared the resulting content with Chat and asked for additional criticism.  The response seemed to be mostly formatting and voice suggestions.

 ...And then magic happened.

 There you have it, folks.  Some AI generated constructive criticism and tom-foolery all rolled up into a single package.  
 
 +1 for ChatGPT.  I'm definitely coming back for more.
