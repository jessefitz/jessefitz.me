# The Old Mill Town

There's an old mill town where I grew up.  It's a destination.  People go there to see a part of our region's history.  Lovers go there to swoon over a cup of coffee or to conspicuously share moments of tenderness seated on side street benches.  Younger people feel safe to be different there.  It's a place for pain and happiness, nostalgia and newness, change and familiarity.

Time and weather are foes to the old mill town.  Fires have ravaged businesses and livelihoods.  Flood waters have washed away large swaths of the quaintest corners.  I've seen footage of cars being lazily consumed by the raging river.  

Year after year the damage seems to mount.  Taxpayers spend millions to fend off future destruction.  The roots of the tree rot while we struggle to cull the sick branches and divert attention from the crevices forming along the trunk.

Yet the people still crowd the streets and shops when nice weather begins to beckon.  New memories are created.  Local businesses flourish.  Why wouldn't they?  It's beautiful and we long for these things.  These experiences.

Can we go back to the places we once were?  Should we allow ourselves these moments of ignorant bliss?  It's all too much to think about when the sun is shining and memories call.
