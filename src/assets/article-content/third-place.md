The "third place" concept was proposed by sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who argued that gathering places outside of work and home play a crucial role in one's social and emotional well-being, specifically as it pertains to developing a sense of belonging in society.

This resonates. My "third places" have changed and evolved over the years.  Earlier in life they were sports teams, extracurricular clubs, and even church groups.  As an adult they began to dwindle, especially as I became less attracted to those gathering places centered on consumption of alcohol.  

I propose post-COVID American society suffers from something greater than the third place problem.  We've actively combined home and work into a single place.  A vast majority of the third places that still exist are so focused on monetized consumption that they're (a) not widely accessible to large swaths of society and (b) are no longer conducive to the development of healthy interactions and connections.

Just yesterday a colleague argued (over a virtual meeting, of course) that working from home leads to greater productivity and efficiency.  I argue that it's a fallacy.  Combining the *workplace* with the *homeplace* denies us an opportunity to build deeper connections with our teammates.  Those are the same connections that propel teams toward success as they navigate hardships together.  They're the connections that endure ephemeral projects and task work.  It's the stuff that differentiates coworkers from comrades.

Combining the *workplace* with the *homeplace* detracts from the quality of connection with our loved ones.  The separation between time with work and time with family blurs.  These issues pre-date COVID (thanks Blackberry), but they've worsened in recent years. 

These issues are top of mind for me this week as I, quite happily, take significant steps toward separating my *workplace* from my *homeplace*.  I've more thoughts to share now and expect that more will come as this experience unfolds.  To be continued?
