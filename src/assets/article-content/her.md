The 2013 film ["Her"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)) portrays Joaquin Phoenix as a young-ish, single man who passes his days writing heart-felt letters on behalf of paying customers.  We learn early in the movie that he's recently divorced and has a tendency to self-isolate.  He desires and seeks new relationships but fails to make meaningful connections... until he meets Samantha, an AI who exists only has a voice in his ear.

It takes no feat of creative inspiration to imagine the story and drama that follows as a commentary on the power of the AI emerging in our current reality.  

All this talk of the power of generative AI.  Its utility.  Its convenience.  Its flaws.  Its potential.

We need to have a more serious conversation about our own weakness and tendency to be manipulated.  [Hard Fork's latest episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/podcasts/hard-fork-bing-ai-elon.html) touches on this and takes us through a particularly disturbing conversation about love and destruction.

We search for meaning where there isn't any.  We want explanations that simply don't exist.  We want assurances and to know that we are't alone in how we feel or what we want to believe.  We want a common enemy.  

There's no ghost in the machine to give us the answers.  It's all echoes of our former selves.
