# On Usage of AI

The content I author in this site is my own.  I don't use AI to write new articles or generate new topics for me to write about.  I *do* use AI for the following purposes:
- For critical review, much as one would leverage a peer to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve content I generate.
- For sketches and imagery.  Unless otherwise noted, the images I include at the start of my articles were generated based on thoughts/descriptions I input into DALL-E image generator.
