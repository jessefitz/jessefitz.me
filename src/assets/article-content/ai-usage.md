# On Usage of AI

The content I author in this site is my own.  I don't use AI to generate new ideas or written content.  I *do* use AI for the following purposes:
- Sketches and imagery.  Unless otherwise noted, the images I include at the start of my articles were generated based on thoughts/descriptions I input into DALL-E image generator.
- Assistance with website development... ChatGPT specifically.
