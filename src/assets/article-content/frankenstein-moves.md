Today I added some scripts to my repo that will automatically create all of the angular components necessary to render a new page in my site after I've authored a new markdown article.  The script also updates the article directory.  Theoretically speaking, all you really need to do after writing a new article is run the new-jfitzarticle.ps1 script, build/test locally, and then push to GitHub.
