Josh and Chuck (of Stuff You Should Know podcast) have become great friends to me over the years.  Sure, we've never spoken, and obviously they have no idea we're friends, but nonetheless, we're great friends.  

They recently did an episode on [Noncompete Agreements](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/episode/noncompete-agreements-come-on-110070674/) that got me thinking more about some of my own experiences and the IT business in general.

In 2008 I took what we'll refer to as an "involuntary employment break" that began with a very unexpected and poorly executed meeting with my then manager.  Within a few short moments of being told the company was "trimming some fat" I was reminded of my Noncompete Agreement and that the company would graciously consider some leniency its clauses given the circumstances.  What a load of horse shit.

Fast-forward to present day.  We're building a new company from the ground up.  Optimism abounds.

I hope we can be bold enough to resist the temptation that so many others have succumbed to.  Our team should be compelled to work with us because they want to, not because they feel legally prevented from considering alternatives.  People might leave for competitors.  Maybe they'll even poach some of our teammates.

It's not our mission or responsibility to control what the individual chooses.  It's our mission to build a great company and a great product.  If we find people leaving affects our ability to complete this mission, we need to take a long look in the mirror and learn from what we see.  A great company sees their flaws and invests in improvement.
