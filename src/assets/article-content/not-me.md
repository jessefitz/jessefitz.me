We've all seen the movies, maybe read the books.  *New ground-breaking technology enables humans to live beyond death.  Our consciousness may finally transcend the limits of our physical being.  Reserve your spot now... the digital space is filling up fast!*

We're not there, but it sure seems a lot more possible now than it did this time last year.  Just imagine an AI model trained on the troves of data you've created.  Decades of emails and social media posts.  Hundreds (thousands?) of hours of recorded online meetings.  Terabytes of online photos and videos. 

A soulless version of yourself to brainstorm with. An echo of yourself for future generations to consult for advice, entertainment and comfort....*AI.me*

AI has obviously been top of mind for me lately, especially this idea of AI being used to represent (recreate?) oneself.  One stop on this train of thought:  Generative AI and the role it's already begun to play in the *misrepresentation* of ourselves and the world around us.

The thought inspired me to create something... and given the temporal nature of inspiration... I blew the good part of a weekend creating [not.jessefitz.com](https://not.jessefitz.me).

[not.jessefitz.com](https://not.jessefitz.me) is a small scratch at the surface of generative self-augmentation.  Define a persona at the top of the page, then browse any of the content in /articles to see it rendered as that persona might have authored it.  Behind the scenes it's the same site, content and codebase, but instead of rendering the content as I've authored it, it's being routed through OpenAI.

There's still work to do.  It's not fast, but it's fun.  Some personas that I've found particularly entertaining:
- A sentient black hole bent on consuming the entire universe
- A dog learning to speak English that still barks and forgets to use words
- Shakespeare
- a 1980's rap artist that speaks only in lyrics
- a haiku artist
