## A Bridge

There's a small bridge that sits between a quiet village and a bustling metropolis.  The sounds and smells of each side gather thickly in the middle of the bridge.  Underneath flows a whispering creek with swirling pools and trout that swim like shadows through the water.  The man crossing the bridge pauses to watch them.  They seem unconcerned.
