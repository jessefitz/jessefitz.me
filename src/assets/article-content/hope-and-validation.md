Listening to another episode of [Hard Fork](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/podcasts/hard-fork-sundar.html?action=click&module=audio-series-bar&region=header&pgtype=Article) today, feeling a small sense of pride and a larger sense of hope. Why?
- Google CEO Sundar Pichai is also touting the creative spark he hopes modern AI will bring to our daily lives.
- There's a strong acknowledgment of the arms race that is well underway and the concerns around it.

To hear Google's CEO in his own voice acknowledge the spectrum of possibilities and outcomes is like hearing my college professor quoting arguments from my final project during a class lecture.

It's inspiring and terrifying.
