The [latest episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/podcasts/bings-revenge-and-googles-ai-face-plant.html) in Hard Fork's series explores recent developments with ChatGPT's integration into Bing and Google's botched attempt to showcase its competitor, Bard.

Google and Microsoft are obviously the bigs in the room.  There are other players out there.  In my mind they're all poised like blind-folded robots at a starting line, not really understanding the course ahead, what direction to go, or if there really is a finish line at all.

It's a dangerous race... one that may have massive implications for ourselves and generations to come.  We need to understand our role.  Are we here as spectators to be entertained?  Do we hold the starting gun?  The flag at the finish?  Are we sure we even want to be here?
