On remote work… I know I’m an outlier here. Maybe I’m old school, maybe I’m just old. But I believe that teams who work together in person build more than just their product. They build a shared language, a deeper understanding of one another, and a stronger foundation that can withstand the inevitable crisis-of-whatever. They create a framework that can scale the team to infinity and beyond (thanks, Buzz).

I once heard someone say, during a virtual interview ironically, "You need to be in the same room, breathing the same air, to truly know each other." That resonated with me. There’s got to be a better middle ground than what we’ve settled on in this post-COVID world. Twice-annual meetups are fun, but they don’t foster the kind of team-building I’m talking about. Neither do quarterly ones. Monthly? I’m not sure. I don’t have the answer, but I’m searching for it, and I’m not giving up.

One thing I know for sure is that "back-to-office" mandates are NOT the answer. None of this building happens in forced environments. There’s no benefit to a team sitting together just because they’re required to. It has to feel natural and desirable.

And yes, I get it—we all find our flow in different ways and settings. As leaders, we have a responsibility to enable that, through the culture and space we create.
