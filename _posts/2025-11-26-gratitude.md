## My Early Foundation and Mentorship

I’m grateful for the broad experience I gained at AIS (Applied Information Sciences) and for early mentors  whose guidance shaped how I think and solve problems.

## Leaders Who Opened Doors

I’m grateful for the people who quietly gave me opportunities to lead, and for the organizations that have trusted me to step directly into leadership roles.

## Teams and Colleagues Who Trusted Me

I’m grateful for the teams and individuals who put their faith in me as a leader and challenged me at the right moments.

## The Builders and Supporters of Verfico

I’m grateful for the investors, early users, and partners who helped shape the Verfico journey and made the experience possible. 

## The Communities That Strengthen and Support

I’m grateful for the camaraderie and crew at the Maryland Innovation Center and for the Howard County nonprofits (Bridges to Housing Stability, Horizon Foundation, Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center) that consistently show up and support the community in which we thrive.
