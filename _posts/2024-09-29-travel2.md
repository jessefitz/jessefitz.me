Left home late morning of the 28th, arrived at Findley State Park.  There was a hint of rain in the air.  By the time I got back from the Village Mart in Wellington it was a steady downpour.

The rain continued heavy through the night and into the early morning.  Erring on side of better judgement, I packed my shit up and drove for a few hours until I could find somewhere dry enough to get coffee and make breakast.

Rock Cut State Park sits outside of Rockford, Illinois.  Carla at the front desk was kind enough to get me a secluded site on the water for a whopping $12.  Dry, sunny and peaceful.

Tossed a spinner bait for a few minutes and got this little guy.
