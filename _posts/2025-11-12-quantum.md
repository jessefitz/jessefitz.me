A few key takeaways from the quantum technologies event I attended last night:

-If you ever need to be reminded that there are people wayyyy smarter than you, just listen to people who really understand quantum computing explain quantum computing.

-"Q Day" is a thing that we should probably be concerned about, but maybe not because smart people are working on it, but maybe we should because OMG none of our secrets are safe.

-We're still a ways away from practical applications. Big bets are being made that the value will come, but we're playing the long game here.

But, really, quite the event and perspective setter. Thanks to Howard County Economic Development Authority for hosting this mind opening event and Jason Michael Perry for facilitating the engaging panel conversation.
