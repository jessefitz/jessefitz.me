Departed Illinois on Monday after spending the day working at a very busy Meg's Daily Grind in Rockford.  Spent the night at Mirror Lake State Park in Wisconsin.  

Working the next day from a Starbucks in Wisconsin Dels I learned that Wis Dels is home to the nation's largest indoor water park.  Wish I had taken some pictures of the gigantic Transformers figures and other tourist destinations.

It was a long day of work, so didn't get to Whitewater State Park (on the Whitewater River in Minnesota) until late in the evening.  The pictures below were taken from my campsite, which was extremely secluded and felt quite remote.

  Had to stop in Winona on the way to Whitewater while traveling along the Mississippi River.
