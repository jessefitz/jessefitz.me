I'm fortunate to have been a part of many different teams that formed in a variety of ways on a variety of timelines in a variety of situations and under an array of circumstances.  I've enjoyed the predictable unpredictability of creating new teams and joining established teams.  I've strived to learn from each of these endeavors, and I truly hope that, if even in the smallest way, I've had some success in enhancing outcomes and experiences for both the individual team members and team as a whole.

Throughout the 20+ years of my professional journey, I've made the deliberate decision to leave a team only a small handful of times.  It's the most difficult part of moving on.
