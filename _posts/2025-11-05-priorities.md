If there's one piece of advice that I could share with all professionals, but most especially young professionals: Prioritize your health. Make time for exercise. It's more important than that meeting or the deadline. It's more important than networking, or attending that happy hour you've been trying to get to. 

A disciplined exercise routine has always been important to me, but there were significant periods of time where I let it slip, and unhealthy behavior filled that space. Those of you who know me personally know exactly what I'm talking about. 

Good exercise begets good health. Good health begets positivity and productivity. Ample positivity and productivity begets the success you are looking for.

Go for a run. Lift heavy things up and put them back down again. Repeat.
