excerpt: "There's no singular approach."

Don't go into your startup with a preconceived notion of what your team will or must look like. Planning to outsource development? Don’t count on it. Thinking you’ll hire everyone full-time? Probably not. The only thing you can predict with 100% accuracy is that your team will look different 1–2 years down the line than it does at the start. As with most things in the startup world, plan to grow a team that evolves with changing situations and priorities. And I’m not just talking about the tech team—sales, customer support, finance, and beyond. Bring the right people on board, but understand that what feels right at the time may not be the right fit in the future.

This brings me to another hard truth: if you hire friends, family, or close colleagues, be prepared for those relationships to face new strains and turmoil. In a perfect world, it all works out, and everyone rides off into the sunset with bundles of cash and smiles. But it’s not a perfect world, and those imperfections may create situations you’d rather not deal with alongside friends. I’m not saying don’t hire friends—it can definitely work out, and there are plenty of success stories—but be ready for the strain, and make sure it’s something you’re willing to handle.

In my experience, there’s a kind of magic in second-degree connections, especially when they come through someone whose opinion you truly value. Explore as many introductions as you can before committing to a new team member. Never turn down a conversation.

Now, about working with contractors or consultants: most of the time, you should aim to build a relationship with them that mirrors the one you’d have with a full-time employee. This ensures alignment and buy-in. If it feels strained or unnatural, ditch it and move on. A mistake I’ve made too many times is waiting too long and trying too hard to make something work, even when I knew early on it wouldn’t. It’s in everyone’s best interest to end the relationship early if it’s clear it’s not going to work out.
