*This is part 2 of my ongoing pontifications about the past 2 years building and running a startup.  We often learn more from mistakes than we do success, hence the focus on what could have been better.  By exploring the hindsight we strengthen our future position.*

It's been 20+ years since I began building for customers.  Over the years I've recognized the importance of getting to know your customer.  And I mean more than just knowing what product they need or how they want it to work.  I mean understanding them as people and how they operate their business as well as their lives.  The knowledge you gather from getting to know your customer beyond the confines of expectation inevitably leads to better product. 

I went into the startup space confident in my abilities to understand and interact with our target customer base, given my decades of previous consulting experience.  I recognized that building for an entire customer segment would be different, but I made the mistake of thinking that interacting with only a small slice of our target audience would give us the perspective we sought. 

In hindsight, we should have worked harder to engage a much wider swath of our target industry.  We should have leaned into having uncomfortable conversations with strangers who had no reason to tell us we were on to something.  We should have leaned into the [Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/).
