  - Departed: Findley State Park

  - Departed: Rock Cut State Park  
  - Arrive: ~~Buckhorn State Park (Wisconsin)~~ Mirror Lake State Park (Wisconsin)

- **2024-10-01 (Tues) - Through 2024-10-04 (Fri):**  
  - Take rt 90 through the southern portion of Minnesota and South Dakota.  There are a number of state park campgrounds and urban areas that give me plenty of options for both lodging and remote work.  More details to come...
