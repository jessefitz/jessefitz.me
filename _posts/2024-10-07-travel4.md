Memories of the past miles and days have started tangling together.

South Dakota was great.  The drive through the plains from there to Colorado was something.  Just when you think there's no possible way for there to be more miles of vast, open land... you crest a hill to find exactly that.

The drive from Colorado through the Rockies into Utah was awe-inspiring.  Never have I felt so small and yet so connected at the same time.

Below are some pictures from sporadic parts of the the trip since my last update.  I'll be posting a majority of my pictures to the [shared album here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/78asZfAeJLTohpKz8).
