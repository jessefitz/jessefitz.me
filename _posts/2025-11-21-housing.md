There are no throwaway people. THERE. ARE. NO. THROWAWAY. PEOPLE. Say it out loud to yourself. How striking is it that we, the richest community in so many ways, still need to be reminded? 

Yesterday evening Bridges to Housing Stability screened the powerful documentary "Beyond the Bridge: A Solution to Homelessness". It lays the case clear. Housing First WORKS. Look at Houston. Look at Milwaukee. 

We need to be further empowering Housing First programs and initiatives, not walking them back. 

Please find a way to watch the film and educate yourself. The business community must play a key role in moving our nation forward.
