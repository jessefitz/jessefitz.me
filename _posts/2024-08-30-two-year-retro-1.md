Today I wiped out the previous version of jessefitz.me. It was a long time coming.  I forsee a need (or desire) to more rapidly compile and publish my thoughts, and the previous version of this site was not conducive to that.

The inspiration to breath some life back into jessefitz.me came to me early this morning as I was inadvertently thinking about my experience this last two years working in the tech startup space.  I've learned a lot.  Many of these lessons come from success we've seen along the way, but even more seem to emerge from the bumps and bruises that I've been eager to conceal (or ignore).

So, let's do this.  I'm going to start with a few of the most obvious in broad strokes here.  My intention is to elaborate on these and others in subsequent posts.

1. I expected it to be hard.  It's been harder.
2. I expected it to be a welcome change. The only constant we've experienced is change.
3. I thought grit and tenacity would get us to product market fit. It takes more.
4. I expected to learn a lot.  I have.
5. I needed it to be an opportunity to grow.  It has been.

Are these the only lessons?  Hell no.  Are they the most important?  Also no.
